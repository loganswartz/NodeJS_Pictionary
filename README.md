# NodeJS_Pictionary
### By Logan ([@loganswartz](https://github.com/loganswartz)), Aaron ([@originalang](https://github.com/originalang)), and Yedidiya ([@yedidiyam](https://github.com/yedidiyam))
A simple Pictionary app implemented via NodeJS for our "COSC-346 Human-Computer Interaction" class.

## How to install/use
1. Install NodeJS and NPM (google it)
2. `git clone https://github.com/loganswartz/NodeJS_Pictionary`
3. `cd NodeJS_Pictionary`
4. `npm install`
5. `node index.js`
6. Connect to `localhost:3000` in your browser (or the IP address of the host computer, port 3000)

## How to play
Click 'Host a new game', enter your name, and then share the gamecode with other players. Other players will need to connect to your IP address to join, and then enter the gamecode. The 'drawer' can draw on screen and use tools available to them to try to convey the chosen word (without using writing) to all the 'guessers'. First guesser to guess the word wins, and becomes the next drawer.
